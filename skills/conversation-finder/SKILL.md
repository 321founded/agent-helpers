# Conversation Finder

This skill helps find and resume previous Claude Code conversations.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to find conversations about a specific topic (e.g., "find the conversation about bluetooth")
- Asks to resume previous work or discussions
- Wants to see conversations from a specific directory
- Searches for old chat history
- Says something like "what did we talk about X" or "find that conversation where we..."

## Usage

The skill uses the `claude-find` command with various options:

### Basic Search (Display Only)
```bash
claude-find <keyword>
```
Searches all conversations containing the keyword and displays the 30 most recent matches.

**Note**: This only displays results. The shown `claude --resume` command may not work in new terminals due to PATH issues.

### Filter by Current Directory
```bash
claude-find --here
claude-find <keyword> --here
```
Shows only conversations from the current working directory.

### ⭐ Interactive Selection (Recommended)
```bash
claude-find <keyword> --open
```
Displays matching conversations and lets the user select which one to **automatically open in a new terminal**.

The script handles the correct claude command path, so the conversation will open properly.

### ⭐ Auto-Open Most Recent (Recommended)
```bash
claude-find <keyword> --auto
```
Automatically opens the most recent matching conversation in a new terminal.

The script handles the correct claude command path, so the conversation will open properly.

## What It Shows

For each conversation, you'll see:
- Date and time of last activity
- Project/directory path
- Summary (if available)
- First and last messages (truncated)
- Number of messages
- `[compacted]` marker if the conversation was compressed
- Command to resume: `claude --resume <session-id>`

## Examples

```bash
# Just search and display results (doesn't open)
claude-find bluetooth

# ⭐ Find and auto-open the most recent conversation (RECOMMENDED)
claude-find manutan --auto

# ⭐ Search and interactively select which one to open (RECOMMENDED)
claude-find statusline --open

# Show all conversations in current directory
claude-find --here

# Combine filters: search for keyword in current directory and auto-open
claude-find workspace --here --auto
```

## Technical Details

- Script location: `~/.claude/skills/conversation-finder/claude-find`
- Searches: `~/.claude/projects/` for session files
- Sorting: By last activity timestamp (handles compacted sessions)
- Terminal: Opens using `xdg-terminal-exec` (your default terminal)
- Permissions: Uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to skip trust prompts

## Important: How to Open Conversations

When you find a conversation, there are two ways to open it:

### ❌ Manual (Not Recommended)
Copying the `claude --resume <session-id>` command from search results may fail in new terminals due to PATH configuration.

### ✅ Automatic (Recommended)
Use `--open` or `--auto` flags:
- The script automatically uses the full path to the claude command
- Opens the conversation in the correct working directory
- Skips permission prompts with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

**Example**: Instead of running `claude --resume 173e38ee...`, use:
```bash
claude-find touchpad --auto
```

## Notes

- Results are limited to 30 most recent conversations
- Keyword search is case-insensitive
- Search looks through entire conversation content, not just summaries
- Conversations are sorted by last activity, so compacted/resumed conversations appear with their latest timestamp
- The script uses `/home/alexis/data/node/.npm-global/bin/claude` as the full path to ensure commands work in new terminals
